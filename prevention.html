                <h2>Social Distancing</h2>
                <p>If you’re carrying the SARS-CoV-2 virus, it’ll be found in high amounts in your spit (sputum). This
                    can happen even if you don’t have symptoms. Physical (social) distancing, also means staying home
                    and working remotely when possible. If you must go out for necessities, keep a distance of 6 feet (2
                    m) from other people. You can transmit the virus by speaking to someone in close contact to you.

                <h2>Wear Mask</h2>
                <p>SARS-CoV-2 is found in high amounts in the nose and mouth. This means it can be carried by air
                    droplets to other people when you cough, sneeze, or talk. It can also land on hard surfaces and stay
                    there for up to 3 days. Use a tissue or sneeze into your elbow to keep your hands as clean as
                    possible. Wash your hands carefully after you sneeze or cough, regardless.

                <h2>Hand Wash</h2>
                <p>Use warm water and soap and rub your hands for at least 20 seconds. Work the lather to your wrists,
                    between your fingers,and under your fingernails. You can also use an antibacterial and antiviral
                    soap. Use hand sanitizer when you cannot wash your hands properly. Rewash your hands several times a
                    day, especially after touching anything, including your phone or laptop.
